You are a highky skilled UI developer and also a great backend developer. I want you to generate a proffesional looking Landing page with a navbar in green theme ( Same theme used in index.html).  There should be a Register and login page. When the user register for the first time. The name, age, Weight and height should be asked. After the user inputs weight and height, BMI should be calculated automatically. The Age and BMI should be remembered by the page and used in index.html file which is located in the templates. All the pages should be professional and at the same time it should have really great animations like sudden swish in, fade in, text animation, fading when scrolled, marquees, etc. You can also give a tail like animation for cursor and when clicked a small bubble will papear at the place of click. Not just this, Add many more great animations you can. The frontend should be in HTML, CSS and JS. The backend you can write in Node js, Mongo DB and for the database, use MySQL
